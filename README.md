# Grokking Algorithms

A practical implementation of algorithms and data structures concepts from the book "Grokking Algorithms" (Second Edition) by Aditya Bhargava. This repository contains my implementations as I work through each chapter of the book, serving as a hands-on learning resource for understanding fundamental algorithms through working code examples.

## üéØ Project Overview

This repository contains my implementations of various algorithms and data structures as I progress through the "Grokking Algorithms" (Second Edition) book. The algorithms are organized by chapters for easy navigation and learning. Each algorithm is implemented with clear, readable code and includes practical examples as I work through the concepts.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - Fast JavaScript runtime
- TypeScript (optional, for type checking)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd grokking-algorithms
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```

### Running the Code

#### Run the main entry point:
```bash
bun run index.ts
```

#### Run specific algorithm examples:
```bash
# Run binary search example
bun run 1-introduction-to-algorithms/binary-search.js
```

**Note:** Each chapter has its own README with detailed information about the algorithms and concepts covered. See the chapter folders for more details.

## üìñ Learning Path

This project follows my learning journey through the "Grokking Algorithms" (Second Edition) book:

1. **Read the chapter** - I study each chapter of the book thoroughly
2. **Implement the algorithms** - I code the algorithms as I understand them
3. **Test and experiment** - I run examples and modify parameters to deepen understanding
4. **Document my learning** - Each implementation includes comments explaining my understanding
5. **Progress through chapters** - I add new algorithms as I advance through the book

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add more algorithms or improve existing implementations:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Add your algorithm implementation
4. Include clear comments and examples
5. Submit a pull request

## üìù Notes

- All algorithms are implemented as I learn them from the "Grokking Algorithms" (Second Edition) book
- Each implementation includes practical examples and my understanding of the concepts
- Code follows modern JavaScript/TypeScript best practices
- Focus is on understanding rather than optimization (though efficient implementations are preferred)
- This is a work in progress - new chapters and algorithms will be added as I continue reading
